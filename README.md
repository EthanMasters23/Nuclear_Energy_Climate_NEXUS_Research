# Navigating the Nexus: Climate Change, Clean Energy, and Nuclear

This review explores the intersections of climate change, clean energy, and nuclear nonproliferation to better understand the current status of the field.

## Project Description

The global security implications of climate change necessitate unprecedented investments in alternative clean energy sources. Among these, nuclear energy stands out due to its potential to improve energy security, foster economic growth, and significantly reduce global emissions. This literature review delves into the multifaceted debates surrounding clean energy, with a particular focus on nuclear technologies, and examines how these technologies intersect with climate change and nuclear nonproliferation.

This repository contains a comprehensive review of existing literature within the nexus of climate change, clean energy, and nuclear nonproliferation. It includes insights from journal articles, books, world organization reports, and conference proceedings, collected using a robust methodology involving multiple academic search engines and advanced qualitative data analysis tools like Leximancer.

## Goals

1. **Analyze the intersections:** Understand how climate change, clean energy, and nuclear nonproliferation interact and impact each other.
2. **Assess nuclear energy's role:** Evaluate the potential and risks of nuclear energy as a clean energy source within the context of climate change mitigation.
3. **Inform policy and strategy:** Provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the energy and security sectors.

## Methodology

- **Literature Collection:** Utilized academic search engines (Google Scholar, Scopus, etc.) and reference tracing.
- **Qualitative Data Analysis:** Employed Leximancer for thematic and relational analyses to extract semantic patterns and insights from the literature.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Isolated publications in five-year intervals to understand the evolution of the field.

## Key Insights

### Concept Map Overview

- **Main Themes:** The primary themes identified include nuclear energy, weapons, energy policy, climate change, and global security.
- **Sub-Level Concepts:** Key sub-level concepts include fuel processing, IAEA regulations, Russia's market position, and the role of the United States.
- **Implications:** The concept map highlights the relevance of energy policy, safety concerns, and the geopolitical implications of nuclear technologies in the context of climate change and nonproliferation.

## Conclusion

The review concludes that nuclear energy is likely to play a significant role in the global clean energy mix, given its potential to provide stable, zero-carbon energy. However, the risks of nuclear proliferation and safety concerns must be strategically managed. Policymakers must consider these intersections to ensure both energy security and global safety.
