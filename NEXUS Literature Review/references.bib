abstract = {The pursuit of civil nuclear power, frequently justified in the name of national energy security, paradoxically entangles most states in long-term interdependencies with the few countries that can supply nuclear technologies. These interdependencies are insufficiently documented and poorly understood. This article presents and analyzes a new dataset of nuclear cooperation agreements signed or announced between 2000 and 2015. We find that Russia and the US dominate international technological nuclear cooperation, with the US’ dominance particularly prominent in safety and security and Russia's in nuclear power plant construction, reactor and fuel supply, decommissioning and waste. When it comes to these technologies, Russia is the supplier in approximately half of all agreements; France, the US, China, Korea, and Japan together account for another 40. All in all, six countries are suppliers in over 90 of all international nuclear agreements, a far higher supplier concentration than in oil and gas markets. These results show that the global future of nuclear power depends as much on international cooperation as on national motivations and capacities. Effective policies and institutions supporting the safe use of nuclear power should therefore be directed at managing its international as well as national aspects.}

The United States is projected to decline as the global leader in nuclear power production due to stagnation in the industry. Alongside this trend, US public skepticism of nuclear energy has remained high for decades. Policymakers, industry, and pro- and anti-nuclear advocates must understand these attitudes given electricity needs, energy sector competition, and climate change. Existing scholarship explains public opinion on nuclear power by comparing its economic and environmental desirability with other energy sources. Yet, a critical area of public opinion remains understudied: the connection between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Scholars have theorized such a relationship in the public consciousness, but the premise has not been systematically investigated. Two studies examine this theoretical linkage. Study 1 uses a nationally representative US survey experiment (n=904) to validate that public attitudes toward civilian and military nuclear technologies are indeed related. Study 2 uses an exploratory survey experiment (n=1,003) to show that persuasive information about each technology affects opinion about the other. These studies provide evidence of psychological linkage. In fact, attitudes toward nuclear weapons may even drive those on nuclear energy.}

And, last but not least, the willingness to cooperate of the states currently developing those activities of enrichment and recycling.

ABSTRACT = {In recent decades, the nuclear export market has observed a marked shift of demand from traditional customers in the Western world to Asia. The lack of projects in the United States, the delay in the French construction of advanced reactors, and the Fukushima accident in Japan have also led to the declining export capabilities of their companies. In contrast, Russia has gained numerous contracts, and China will likely become another major exporter. In this paper, the evolution of the market was examined from both the supply and demand sides with issues including the more concentrated and uncertain market, the lack of full participation by emerging suppliers to the nonproliferation regime, and the lesser governance capabilities of the newcomers. Addressing these issues, a range of policy suggestions was made, including the reinforcement of market shares of Western suppliers, the encouragement of newcomers to adhere to international norms, and a better safeguards contribution scheme.},

 abstract = {America’s twentieth-century policy on the peaceful uses of nuclear power was original US strategic thinking. It was a policy founded on a rules-based liberal international order shaped by personal experiences and aligned with comprehensive, long-term national security objectives. However, in the twenty-first century, the US is embroiled in a national discussion as to whether it should advance its civilian nuclear power enterprise or abandon it altogether. This disposition conflicts with America’s original nuclear power policy and does not align with twenty-first-century realities. Nuclear power generation is not merely a domestic energy issue subject to popular opinion or the volatility of energy markets. Competing powers are leveraging civilian nuclear collaborations to meet strategic geopolitical objectives. If America retreats from the civilian nuclear field, revisionist powers will become the global leaders in nuclear science, nuclear engineering, and nuclear technology in the twenty-first-century with adverse implications for US national security. Thus, the civilian nuclear power enterprise should be included as a strategic sector within the US national security industrial base and deliberated as a foreign policy issue within a global alliance.},

But their decision has also raised suspicion in some quarters amidst the fears of militarisation of their nuclear programmes, which may lead to an arms race in the region. Nuclear programmes of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Saudi Arabia have been termed as an effort to counter the Iranian nuclear programme. Similarly, Syrian and Egyptian nuclear programmes are suspected to be intended against Israel.

Due to limitations of other low-carbon energy sources, nuclear power may be required to provide ∼30\% of world electrical energy by 2100. Calculations of the associated stocks and flows of uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides indicate that the proliferation risks at mid-century, using current light-water reactor technology, are daunting. There are institutional arrangements that may be able to provide an acceptable level of risk mitigation, but they will be difficult to implement. If a transition is begun to fast-spectrum reactors at mid-century, the global nuclear proliferation risks become much greater by 2100, and more resistant to mitigation. Fusion energy, if successfully demonstrated to be economically competitive, would provide a source of nuclear power with much lower proliferation risks than fission. }

Nuclear energy today avoids the emission of nearly two billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) each year, thanks to over 400 reactors operating worldwide. Nevertheless, there is no real recognition of real incentives for large-scale non-emitters like nuclear energy and for emissions avoidance in current Kyoto and other policies. These approaches rely heavily on conservation, renewables and efficiency. These measures alone also will not significantly reduce the atmospheric greenhouse burden, because the world is still growing. Also, our (the world's) future economic growth (in all countries) is tied to energy and electricity use. Our prosperity, the alleviation of poverty and the sustainability of the world depend on having a supply of emissions-free and safe energy. Recent price hikes in fossil fuels and power blackouts also emphasize our need for reliable, safe and cheap power, as is offered by nuclear energy when coupled with effective and secure waste disposal. A particularly important role for nuclear power in the future will be its links to the hydrogen economy. It is now recognised that the introduction of hydrogen into the transportation sector will benefit the environment only when low carbon sources, such as nuclear reactors, are the primary energy source for hydrogen production. The future could well be the Hydrogen Age. We show that a major reduction in GHGs worldwide can be obtained by nuclear-electric production of hydrogen, thus alleviating their potential effects on future generations. We also demonstrate a potential key synergism with renewable wind power in the hybrid production of distributed hydrogen. Thus, nuclear energy supports and enables the World in its journey to a sustainable, safe and secure energy future.}

Results based on multilevel models for 27 to 29 European nations reveal relatively low support for nuclear energy, even among those concerned about climate change, but consistent patterns of determinants. At the individual level, high socioeconomic status tends to increase support for nuclear energy. At the national level, the presence of operating nuclear power plants in a country leads to higher public support. Both these results more strongly support arguments focusing on the importance of familiarity with the technology than arguments focusing on postmaterialist values. In addition, rightist political views increase support for nuclear energy, but political divisions prove particularly important in high-income nations with postmaterialist values. }

Concern has grown that, with a stagnating domestic nuclear industry and declining export industry, the U.S. will lose a significant tool of foreign policy and leverage in maintaining strong international standards. While the issue has been discussed extensively in the policy community and used as a powerful rhetorical tool to motivate tangentially related policies such as subsidizing existing U.S. nuclear plants, no one has systematically assessed the issue, structured the problem and proposed and evaluated potential solutions. Here we briefly analyze the current international state of play, and then outline a set of specific strategies the U.S. might adopt on its own, or promote internationally, to retain its influence. Building on the literature, nuclear security and nuclear power experts assisted us in framing the issues and then, in a participatory workshop, helped us to assess and refine possible strategies. While not all experts agreed that U.S. influence has already declined, most indicated that it likely would decline in the future if present domestic and international trends continue. Although none of the proposed strategies that we advanced or that the experts suggested are likely to be effective in the short term, several warrant ongoing refinements and, if they can be implemented, might have beneficial impacts in coming decades.}

If history is any guide, one direct consequence of the calamity in Japan will be more stringent safety requirements and regulatory delays that will inevitably increase the costs of nuclear power and further undermine its economic viability. For nuclear power to play a major role in meeting the future global energy needs and mitigating the threat of climate change, the hazards of another Fukushima and the construction delays and costs escalation that have plagued the industry will have to be substantially reduced. One promising direction for nuclear development might be to downsize reactors from the gigawatt scale to less-complex smaller units that are more affordable. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are scalable nuclear power plant designs that promise to reduce investment risks through incremental capacity expansion; become more standardized and reduce costs through accelerated learning effects; and address concerns about catastrophic events, since they contain substantially smaller radioactive inventory. Given their lower capital requirements and small size, which makes them suitable for small electric grids, SMRs can more effectively address the energy needs of small developing countries.}

abstract = {Public attitudes towards nuclear power in the UK have historically been deeply divided, but as concern about climate change and energy security has exerted an increasing influence on British energy policy, nuclear power has been reframed as a low-carbon technology. Previous research has suggested that a significant proportion of people may ‘reluctantly accept’ nuclear power as a means of addressing the greater threat of climate change. Drawing on the results of a national British survey (n=1822), the current study found that attitudes towards nuclear remain divided, with only a minority expressing unconditional acceptance. In general, people who expressed greater concern about climate change and energy security and possessed higher environmental values were less likely to favour nuclear power. However, when nuclear power was given an explicit ‘reluctant acceptance’ framing – allowing people to express their dislike for nuclear power alongside their conditional support – concerns about climate change and energy security became positive predictors of support for nuclear power. These findings suggest that concern about climate change and energy security will only increase acceptance of nuclear power under limited circumstances—specifically once other (preferred) options have been exhausted.}

ABSTRACT = {Motivated by the environmental challenges and the increase in energy demand, this review assesses the suitability of nuclear power production as an alternative option to using fossil fuels. First, we assess the competitiveness of nuclear power compared to other power sources considering its economic efficiency, environmental impact and implications for health, and conclude that this is a viable option to serve in addition to and as a backup to renewable sources. Second, we review previous findings in various fields on advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power technology and conclude that there is a gap between reality and perception. Third, we discuss challenges related to nuclear weapons proliferation and misperceived public opinion on nuclear power. We conclude that the gap between perception and reality stems from a lack of consolidated interdisciplinary view, media communications focusing mainly on unilateral assessments.},

    abstract = { In the past decade, human influence on the climate through increased use of fossil fuels has become widely acknowledged as one of the most pressing issues for the global community. For the United Kingdom, we suggest that these concerns have increasingly become manifest in a new strand of political debate around energy policy, which reframes nuclear power as part of the solution to the need for low-carbon energy options. A mixed-methods analysis of citizen views of climate change and radioactive waste is presented, integrating focus group data and a nationally representative survey. The data allow us to explore how UK citizens might now and in the future interpret and make sense of this new framing of nuclear power—which ultimately centers on a risk—risk trade-off scenario. We use the term “reluctant acceptance” to describe how, in complex ways, many focus group participants discursively re-negotiated their position on nuclear energy when it was positioned alongside climate change. In the concluding section of the paper, we reflect on the societal implications of the emerging discourse of new nuclear build as a means of delivering climate change mitigation and set an agenda for future research regarding the (re)framing of the nuclear energy debate in the UK and beyond. }

    abstract = "{The author examines the challenges and opportunities of nuclear power in meeting the projected large absolute increase in energy demand, especially electricity, throughout the industrialized and developing world, while helping to mitigate the threat of climate change. A significant global nuclear power deployment would engender serious risks related to proliferation, safety, and waste disposal. Unlike renewable sources of energy, nuclear power is an unforgiving technology because human lapses and errors can have ecological and social impacts that are catastrophic and irreversible. However, according to some analysts, advances in the design of nuclear reactors may have reduced their associated risks and improved their performance. Moreover, while a variety of renewable energy sources (hydro, wind, modern biomass, solar) will play important roles in the transition to a low-carbon economy, some analysts perceive that nuclear power is the only proven technology for generating electricity that is both largely carbon-free, not location specific (as with wind, hydro and solar), and amenable to significant scaling up. Thus given the projections of threats from climate change, and if the considerable strain experienced by world energy markets in recent years is a harbinger of things to come, then there is a rationale for examining the pros and cons of nuclear power as a supply option within low-carbon strategies. It should be noted that despite the emerging centrality of climate change and security of supply in the energy policy debate, nuclear power is still viewed with a great deal of skepticism and in fact continues to elicit considerable opposition. Indeed the views on nuclear power in the context of sustainable energy policy are highly divergent. A thorough evaluation of all aspects of the issue is warranted.}",

 abstract = {In a vitally important book for anyone interested in nuclear
proliferation, defense strategy, or international security, Matthew
Kroenig points out that nearly every country with a nuclear weapons
arsenal received substantial help at some point from a more
advanced nuclear state. Why do some countries help others to
develop nuclear weapons? Many analysts assume that nuclear
transfers are driven by economic considerations. States in dire
economic need, they suggest, export sensitive nuclear materials and
technology-and ignore the security risk-in a desperate search for
hard currency.Kroenig challenges this conventional wisdom. He finds that state
decisions to provide sensitive nuclear assistance are the result of
a coherent, strategic logic. The spread of nuclear weapons
threatens powerful states more than it threatens weak states, and
these differential effects of nuclear proliferation encourage
countries to provide sensitive nuclear assistance under certain
strategic conditions. Countries are more likely to export sensitive
nuclear materials and technology when it would have the effect of
constraining an enemy and less likely to do so when it would
threaten themselves.In Exporting the Bomb, Kroenig examines the most
important historical cases, including France's nuclear assistance
to Israel in the 1950s and 1960s; the Soviet Union's sensitive
transfers to China from 1958 to 1960; China's nuclear aid to
Pakistan in the 1980s; and Pakistan's recent technology transfers,
with the help of "rogue" scientist A. Q. Khan, from 1987 to 2002.
Understanding why states provide sensitive nuclear assistance not
only adds to our knowledge of international politics but also aids
in international efforts to control the spread of nuclear
weapons.},

However, human well-being can also be affected by socio-economic and environmental impacts associated with the use of different primary energy sources. Nuclear energy production is perceived as one means of satisfying national energy demand while contributing to a potentially sustainable energy transition. The objective of this study is to further understand socio-economic, environmental and technological factors that characterize countries that choose nuclear energy production. Hence, this exploratory study reviews the socio-economic contexts of nuclear energy producing countries in comparison to countries without nuclear energy use. The study is based on world development indicators published by World Bank for 213 countries between 1960 and 2013 and follows two analytical steps. First, based on a comparison of countries average development indicator values over time, we descriptively explore which socio-economic, environmental and technological factors characterize the spectrum of countries following different 'nuclear energy strategies' (no nuclear production, phase-out, planning to produce, produce nuclear energy). Second we statistically analyze nuclear energy producing countries, exploring if there was significant change in socio-economic, environmental and technological characteristics after the start of nuclear energy production. Characteristics of our four country groups revealed nuclear countries (incl. phase-out) used more energy per capita and showed higher levels of carbon emissions as well as household consumption compared to countries planning to use nuclear energy and countries without nuclear energy use. Adoption of nuclear energy does not appear to reduce fossil fuel use or enable energy independence. Hence, our study did not provide evidence that nuclear energy production can be seen as technological answer to global challenges like climate change or unequal energy distribution. It is therefore unclear if and how nuclear energy contributes to global human well-being as part of sustainable development.}

 abstract = {America’s twentieth-century policy on the peaceful uses of nuclear power was original US strategic thinking. It was a policy founded on a rules-based liberal international order shaped by personal experiences and aligned with comprehensive, long-term national security objectives. However, in the twenty-first century, the US is embroiled in a national discussion as to whether it should advance its civilian nuclear power enterprise or abandon it altogether. This disposition conflicts with America’s original nuclear power policy and does not align with twenty-first-century realities. Nuclear power generation is not merely a domestic energy issue subject to popular opinion or the volatility of energy markets. Competing powers are leveraging civilian nuclear collaborations to meet strategic geopolitical objectives. If America retreats from the civilian nuclear field, revisionist powers will become the global leaders in nuclear science, nuclear engineering, and nuclear technology in the twenty-first-century with adverse implications for US national security. Thus, the civilian nuclear power enterprise should be included as a strategic sector within the US national security industrial base and deliberated as a foreign policy issue within a global alliance.},

The book formulates a theory of nuclear socio-political economy which highlights six factors necessary for embarking on nuclear power programs: (1) national security and secrecy, (2) technocratic ideology, (3) economic interventionism, (4) a centrally coordinated energy stakeholder network, (5) subordination of opposition to political authority, and (6) social peripheralization. The book validates this theory by confirming the presence of these six drivers during the initial nuclear power developmental periods in eight countries: the United States, France, Japan, Russia (the former Soviet Union), South Korea, Canada, China, and India. The authors then apply this framework as a predictive tool to evaluate contemporary nuclear power trends. They discuss what this theory means for developed and developing countries which exhibit the potential for nuclear development on a major scale, and examine how the new “renaissance” of nuclear power may affect the promotion of renewable energy, global energy security, and development policy as a whole. The volume also assesses the influence of climate change and the recent nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan, on the nuclear power industry’s trajectory. This book will be of interest to students of energy policy and security, nuclear proliferation, international security, global governance and IR in general. © 2012 Benjamin K.

It can be chosen as the main source of power generation in some countries or complement the energy matrix in others. In this context, there is the need to develop new technologies for the management of radioactive waste generated by the production process. Final repositories for spent fuel are not yet in commercial operation, and techniques for fuel reprocessing have been developed, because after use, the fuel still has materials that produce energy. Some countries already use reprocessing, and develop research to make it more secure and more competitive, while others prefer to adopt policies to prevent developments in this area due to the problem of nuclear proliferation. In another line of research, new reactors are being developed in order to reduce the amount of waste in energy production and some will be designed to work in closed loop, recycling the materials generated.}

We use the dataset that divides technological nuclear cooperation into two categories - concrete and supportive, where concrete cooperation involves the more in-depth transfer of technology related to nuclear power and fuel cycle than supportive cooperation. We employ multinomial regression analysis to investigate what economic, political, military, and non-proliferation considerations enable more concrete nuclear cooperation. Our empirical results suggest that potential proliferation uncertainty exists in concrete cooperation. While concrete nuclear cooperation, in general, requires compliance with non-proliferation norms more strictly than supportive cooperation, examining military factors together with the compliance to the non-proliferation norms shows some concerns. Specifically, we find that suppliers of concrete nuclear cooperation have overlooked weak compliance with some non-proliferation norms when there exist common military interests. We also show that client countries with high military expenditure are more likely to engage in more concrete nuclear cooperation. Lastly, we find that supplier and client countries tend to complement their weak military alliance with more concrete nuclear cooperation. The findings underscore the responsibility of major suppliers and the international community for nuclear non-proliferation.}
